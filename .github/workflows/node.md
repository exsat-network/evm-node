## Triggers
This GitHub action will run under the following circumstances:
1. When code is pushed.
1. Workflow dispatch event, a manual CI run, which can be triggered by the "Workflow Dispatch" button in the Actions tab of the GitHub repository, among other means.

## Inputs
The inputs for this GitHub action are:
1. `GITHUB_TOKEN` - a GitHub Actions intrinsic used to access the repository and other public resources.
1. `TRUSTEVM_CI_APP_ID` - the app ID of the `trustevm-ci-submodule-checkout` GitHub App.
1. `TRUSTEVM_CI_APP_KEY` - the private key to the `trustevm-ci-submodule-checkout` GitHub App.
1. `upload-artifacts` - a boolean input that specifies whether or not to upload the artifacts of the build. The default value is `false`. This can be overridden in manual CI runs.

These inputs are used in various steps of the workflow to perform actions such as authentication, downloading artifacts, configuring the build, and uploading artifacts.

## Steps
This workflow performs the following steps:
1. Attach Documentation
    1. Checkout the repo with no submodules.
    1. Attach an annotation to the GitHub Actions build summary page containing CI documentation.
1. EOS EVM Node Build
    1. Authenticate to the `trustevm-ci-submodule-checkout` GitHub app using the [AntelopeIO/github-app-token-action](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/github-app-token-action) action to obtain an ephemeral token.
    1. Checkout the repo and submodules using the ephemeral token.
    1. Build exsat-evm-node and exsat-evm-rpc using `cmake` and `make`.
    1. Upload the build folder to GitHub Actions if the `upload-artifacts` input is set to `true`.

## Outputs
This workflow produces the following outputs:
1. Build Artifacts - `build.tar.gz` containing the built artifacts of exsat-evm-node and exsat-evm-rpc, if the `upload-artifacts` input is set to `true`.

> 💾️ Build artifacts are only attached on-demand for this pipeline because they are >117 MB each, but we only get 2 GB of cumulative artifact storage in GitHub Actions while eos-evm is a private repo. Obtain artifacts by performing a manual build with `upload-artifacts` set to `true`.
